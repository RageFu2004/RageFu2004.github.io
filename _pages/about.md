Hi! I am Haowei Fu, currently a senior undergraduate student at Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof. Tyler Derr in NDS Lab at Vanderbilt. Before, I was grateful to work with Prof.Meiyi Ma in AI-CPS Lab at Vanderbilt and Dr. Chayan Chatterjee at Data Science Institute Vanderbilt.

Research Interest
======
1. Multimodal Learning: I am interested in how to learn representation in multimodal environment, especially when data is sparse and noise-dominated. I am interested in how we transfer learning in rich-modality model to low-resource modalities.
2. Trustworthy AI: I am interested in privacy attack and defense of LLMs. Currently I work on Membership-Inference Attack in text-based LLMs. I am interested in privacy in Multimodal LLMs.
3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation: I am interested in RAG on structured knowledge such as graph and their application in personalization in text generation and recommender system.
